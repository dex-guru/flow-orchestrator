## Roadmap

![The San Juan Mountains are beautiful!](/assets/img/roadmap.svg)

## GPT Revolution Happened Now What?

For Application developers it’s became expected that they embed GPT mechanics, and market is growing as well as workforce is forced to use AI Processors more in more in daily routines, points:

- People became used to GPT flow mechanics.
- If you’re building in 2024 you expected to have GPT/AI Mechanics implemented in your application.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) applications enhancing GPT output by integrating external information retrieval widely appearing as portion of help/service desk business processes.
- Multi-step AI Processors are used by professional GPT users in their daily activities and work life.
- We believe projects driving GTP Revolution towards utilization of financial tooling of Web3 World would prevail in this cycle.

## New Vision: Scaling What Works

## Our Vision

We simplify AI Focused Applications Development

- Easy to use and embed BPA (Blockchain Process Automation) AI, Transactions and User Flow orchestration snippets and data views.
- Orchestration layer for on-chain/off-chain/user and AI interactions why it’s crucial dApps Developers and RAG Developers and AI Models providers?
- We’ve built Dex Guru Platform with idea of boosting up development process while keeping maintenance loses in control.
- We run half a dozen complex projects deployed over 18 chains with lean team, GPT Integrations and OnChain/OffChain actions orchestrated and that’s why we think everyone can do it with our tooling.

## How GURU Platform Works?

### Orchestrated Execution

On-chain/Off-chain/User/AI Business Process Automation (BPA) through FlowOrchestrator

Automation instructions are designed as BPMN(Business Process Model and Notation). Deployed as on-chain smart contract and off-chain orchestration node.

### Embeddable insights

Platform also serves as CMS for DexGuru and Ecosystem products where insights are embedded in different forms. They already working for us, and can work for you. Allowing for fast features testing and roll outs.

## Flow Orchestrator

Orchestrator is in a core of GURU Platform Ecosystem powering up all connection and financial means of GURU Network:

- Provides single execution context for variety of environments (on-chain/off-chain/user/AI interactions)
- Seamlessly orchestrate multi-steps LLM/AI models using orchestration snippets catalog
- Reuse Published BPA Definitions
- Distribute Execution when working in pair with GURU Wallet, which allows remote execution from FlowOrchestration on particular actions.
- EventBus exposed on GURU Network as an Oracle

## GURU Network: AI as a Service

### Available Today

- Data Driven GPT as a Service based of particular chain or protocol data presented on Data Warehouse dashboards
- AI Assistant with context of dAPP data and protocol insides working off the dashboards and queries created in Guru Warehouse and embedded in dAPPS

### In Development

- Blockchain data Science Research assistant
- AI-powered time-series forecasting & anomaly detection (Inflow, Outflows, smart contract risks).
- Behavioral analytics and P&L analysis.
- ERC-20/NFT Sniping Bot AI

## GURU Network Tokenomics

## Allocation and Distribution

- 1B Total Supply, $50M FDV
- About ~20%-30% Initial circulating supply
- Vesting terms: 6 months cliff, 24 month total duration.

## GURU Network Early Adopters

Early adopters projects who opted in to use of Dex Guru Warehouse and later GURU FlowOrchestrator as a Framework for their services launch.
